#  How has the company evolved over the years?

Apple, Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. It was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne on April 1, 1976 to develop and sell personal computers. Jobs later resigned from the company and was replaced by John Sculley who served as Apple CEO until 1993.

During the first decade of the 21st century, Apple expanded its product line to include digital cameras, handheld game consoles, smartphones, and tablet computers. In 2007, Apple introduced the iPhone smartphone which catalyzed the market for mobile apps. In 2011, Apple discontinued the iPod Classic portable media player after 10 years and re-focused its product line on iPhone, iPad, Mac personal computers, and the iCloud cloud storage service.

In 2018, Apple became the first publicly listed U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion. The company employs 123 thousand people as of 2018 and operates 401 retail stores in 24 countries as of 2018.

Apple has seen a lot of changes since it was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. From developing personal computers to becoming a technology giant with products like the iPhone and iPad - the company has come a long way! While there have been some bumps along the way (such as when founder Steve Jobs was ousted from his own company in 1985), for the most part Apple has enjoyed success both commercially and critically.

#  What are the major trends affecting Computer Vision Solutions Berta Rivera 2022 today and into the future?

The advancement of computer vision (CV) technology is revolutionizing the way humans and machines interact. CV solutions are being applied in a number of industries including automotive, retail, healthcare, security and logistics.

Here are some of the major trends affecting CV solutions today and into the future:

1. The increasing demand for face recognition: CV solutions are being used for more sophisticated face recognition applications such as identifying emotions, determining gender and age, and tracking facial movements. As the technology evolves, face recognition is becoming more accurate and efficient, which is driving its increased adoption by businesses.

2. The growth of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR): CV solutions are being used to create realistic 3D environments that can be viewed through headsets or mobile devices. These technologies are becoming increasingly popular, with estimates that the AR/VR market will reach $215 billion by 2021. This presents a huge opportunity for CV developers who can create innovative AR/VR applications that take advantage of the latest hardware advancements.

3. The increasing use of drones: Drones are becoming increasingly popular for commercial purposes due to their ability to provide high-quality aerial footage at a lower cost than traditional methods such as helicopters. CV solutions are being used to improve the accuracy of drone footage by automatically detecting and tracking objects in real-time. This allows businesses to quickly and easily obtain valuable data from aerial surveys without having to manually inspect each image afterwards.

4. The rise of computer vision chips: In order to keep up with the growing demand for CV applications, processor manufacturers are starting to include dedicated computer vision chips in their products. This will make it easier for businesses to deploy CV solutions without having to worry about compatibility issues or performance bottlenecks.

5. The development of autonomous vehicles: Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on CV technology in order to detect obstacles, identify traffic signs, and make safe decisions while driving. As autonomous vehicle technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more widespread adoption across all industries.

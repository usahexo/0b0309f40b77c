#  Casino Tycoon Bets on Mark Twain

Casino Tycoon, Sheldon Adelson, has placed a large bet on the success of author Mark Twain. Adelson has pledged to donate $1 million to the University of Nevada in Las Vegas for a new center that will be dedicated to studying and promoting the work of Twain.

"I've always been a big fan of Mark Twain," said Adelson. "He was a brilliant thinker and writer, and I think he has a lot to teach us about both American history and culture."

The new center is scheduled to open in early 2016 and will feature an interactive exhibit on Twain's life and work, as well as research facilities and classrooms. It will also house the world's largest collection of Twain-related materials.

Adelson is no stranger to giving large donations to universities. In 2013, he gave $25 million to create the School of Medicine at Tel Aviv University. And in 2011, he donated $7.5 million to establish the Adelson Medical Research Foundation, which focuses on curing blindness and other diseases.

#  Diamond Casino to be built in Mark Twain's honor

In a joint announcement, the Mark Twain Foundation and Diamond Casino Corporation have confirmed that the Diamond Casino will be built in the city of Hannibal, Missouri, in honor of America's most celebrated humorist.

"It is our hope that this casino will become an important attraction for visitors to Hannibal and a significant source of revenue for the city and its businesses," said foundation president James Clemens.

The $350 million casino will occupy a 125,000-square-foot site on the banks of the Mississippi River and is expected to generate 1,500 jobs. It will include a hotel, conference center, museum, and theater as well as a gambling floor with 600 slot machines and 30 gaming tables.

The project has been in development for several years, but it was given new impetus last year when Governor Jay Nixon signed legislation authorizing Missouri's first casinos outside of St. Louis and Kansas City. The law also allows casinos to be built on riverboats or on land.

"Hannibal is a perfect location for our casino," said Diamond Casino CEO Walter Cohen. "Not only is it close to St. Louis and Kansas City, but it is also home to one of America's most beloved authors."

Construction is expected to begin later this year and the casino is scheduled to open in early 2016.

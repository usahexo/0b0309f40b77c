#  How to Calculate Your Edge in Sports Betting: Houston Astros Edition



The Houston Astros are currently the odds-on favorite to win the 2017 World Series, according to most sportsbooks. This means that if you want to wager on them, you'll likely have to risk more money than you would on other teams in order to reap a potentially larger reward.

But is the risk worth it? Let's find out by calculating our edge in betting on the Astros.

To do this, we'll need two pieces of information: the odds of the Astros winning and the size of our potential payout. We can get both of these from most online sportsbooks.

In this example, we'll use Oddschecker.com to compare the odds at three different sportsbooks. At the time of writing, these are the odds for the Astros winning the World Series:

Oddschecker.com Sportsbook 1 Sportsbook 2 Sportsbook 3 BetOnline 8/1 7/1 9/2 Bovada 8/1 7/1 9/2 PaddyPower 8/1 6/1 9/2

Note: These odds will change over time, so please be sure to check current odds before placing any bets.


Assuming that we want to bet $100 on the Astros winning the World Series, here are our potential payouts at each sportsbook:

Oddschecker.com Sportsbook 1 Sportsbook 2 Sportsbook 3 BetOnline $800 $700 $1800 Bovada $800 $700 $1800 PaddyPower $800 £600 £1900

As you can see, there is a significant range in potential payouts from different sportsbooks. This is why it's important to shop around and compare odds before placing your bet.

Now that we have all of this information, let's calculate our edge for each sportsbook. To do this, we'll divide our payout by our risk:

Oddschecker.com Sportsbook 1 Sportsbook 2 Sportsbook 3 BetOnline 10% 9% 18% Bovada 10% 9% 18% PaddyPower 10% 10% 19%

As you can see, our edge ranges from 10% at Oddschecker.com up to 19% at PaddyPower. This means that if we wager $100 on each of these sportsbooks, we can expect to make an average profit of between $10 and $19 (depending on which book we choose). So while there is some risk involved in betting on the favorites, there is also a potential for sizable profits.

#  Houston Astros: How to Calculate Your Edge in Sports Betting

The Houston Astros are the defending World Series champions. They enter the 2019 season as +650 favorites to win their second consecutive championship, according to Odds Shark.

Houston is one of the most talented teams in baseball, but they’re not a lock to win the World Series. Bettors who want to back the Astros should calculate their edge and then compare it to the available odds.

In order to calculate your edge, you need to know: (1) your expected value (EV) for each bet, and (2) the odds for each bet.

Your EV is calculated by multiplying your probability of winning by your expected payoff. The expected payoff is what you expect to win on each bet, based on the odds and your expected winning percentage.

For example, let’s say you think Houston has a 60% chance of winning their game against the Boston Red Sox tonight. If the odds are -120 for Houston, then your EV would be 0.6*(-120)=-7.2. This means you can expect to lose 7.2 dollars for every 10 dollars you wager on this game tonight.

Now let’s say that you think Houston has only a 50% chance of winning their game against Boston tonight. If the odds are -120 for Houston, then your EV would be 0.5*(-120)=-6. Now you can expect to lose 6 dollars for every 10 dollars you wager on this game tonight.

In this example, backing Houston at -120 would be a bad decision, since your EV would be negative (you would lose more money than you would win). However, if the odds were +100 instead of -120, then backing Houston would be a good decision, since your EV would be positive (you would win more money than you would lose).

You can also use EV to figure out how much you should risk on each bet. For example, if you have a bankroll of 1000 dollars and want to make 50 bets, then you should risk no more than 20 dollars on each bet (1/50th of your bankroll). This will give you an overall EV of zero, which is what we’re looking for when betting against sportsbooks.

#  Calculating Your Edge in Sports Betting: Houston Astros Edition

The 2017 Houston Astros are a team on the rise, and they offer bettors an excellent opportunity to make some money. In this article, we'll take a look at how to calculate your edge when betting on the Astros, and how to use that information to make winning bets.

When it comes to sports betting, one of the most important things you can do is calculate your edge. This involves taking a close look at both the teams involved in the matchup and the odds being offered by the bookmakers. By doing this, you can determine whether or not there is value in the bet you're considering making.

In order to calculate your edge when betting on the Astros, we'll need to take a look at some key statistics. The first statistic we'll need to look at is win expectancy. Win expectancy is a measure of how likely a team is to win a given game based on their current situation. It takes into account such factors as who is currently batting, who is currently pitching, which bases are occupied, and more.

The next statistic we'll need to look at is Elo rating. Elo rating is a measure of how good (or bad) each team is relative to one another. It's based on historical results and is updated after every game. By looking at both win expectancy and Elo rating, we can get a good idea of how likely each team is to win a given game.

Now that we have all of that information, let's take a look at an example. The Astros are playing the Seattle Mariners, and the odds for this game are as follows:

Houston Astros: +110
00 Seattle Mariners: -130

Let's say that you think the Astros have an 85% chance of winning this game. To calculate your edge in this particular matchup, you would simply subtract Seattle's odds (-130) from Houston's odds (+110), which gives you an edge of +20%. This means that if you were to bet $100 on Houston in this matchup, you would stand to make $120 in profit (assuming they win).

#  How to Make Money Betting on the Houston Astros

Houston Astros have been a great team over the past few years. They have made it to the playoffs 3 times in 4 years and won the World Series in 2017. Their success has lead to an increase in betting on their games.

If you are looking to make some money betting on the Houston Astros, here are a few tips to help you get started:

1)Know the team inside out

The first step to making money betting on the Astros is to know the team inside out. This includes knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each player as well as the team as a whole.

2)Bet against them when they are overvalued

Even though the Astros are a great team, they can still be overvalued at times. When this happens, it can be profitable to bet against them.

3)Take advantage ofparlay and prop bets

There are many different types of bets that can be placed on Astros games. Parlay and prop bets offer the potential for higher payouts than straight-up bets, so be sure to take advantage of them.

4)Monitor line movements closely

Line movements can provide valuable information about which side is being backed by the majority of bettors. Be sure to monitor them closely so that you can make informed bets.

#  Getting the Edge on Sports Betting: Houston Astros Edition

The Houston Astros have had an amazing season and are now in the World Series. Anyone who has watched them knows they are a force to be reckoned with. This got us thinking: is there value in betting on the Astros in this series?

As it turns out, there may be. The odds for the Astros to win the World Series are currently set at +575, which means that a $100 bet would return $575 if they were to win. This is considerably higher than the odds for both the Dodgers and the Indians, who are both set at +200.

Why is this? Well, a lot of it has to do with the fact that the Astros are seen as underdogs in this series. This means that there is more potential profit to be made by betting on them.

Of course, there is always risk associated with any bet, and nothing is guaranteed. However, if you believe in the Astros as much as we do, betting on them may be a great way to make some extra money.

#  Slot machine pays off for Tampa Bay Rays with Borderlands symbols

The Tampa Bay Rays were looking for a little luck of the Irish on Wednesday and they got it with symbols from the popular video game Borderlands.

In the third inning of their game against the Texas Rangers, Rays outfielder Mallex Smith hit a ball that bounced off the wall in left-center field and ricocheted back into play. Smith rounded first base and headed towards second, but was then waved back to first after it was determined that the ball landed in fair territory and was thus a home run.

Upon further review, however, it turned out that the ball had actually struck one of the three golden Borderlands Slot machines that have been placed at Tropicana Field this season. As a result, Smith was awarded an automatic double and two points for his team.

The machines were installed as part of a promotion sponsored by publisher 2K Games and casino operator Eldorado Resorts. Each machine is worth $10,000 in free slot play, and the one nearest to home plate offers a progressive jackpot that is currently worth more than $100,000.

This is not the first time that one of the machines has produced a windfall for a team at Tropicana Field. On April 7th, Jonny Venters of the Atlanta Braves was awarded an automatic triple after his batted ball struck one of the machines.

"I saw it on TV once before. I didn't know what to do," said Venters about getting his extra base hit. "I just ran."

The Rays are hoping for more Borderlands luck as they make their final playoff push. With young stars like Smith and ace Blake Snell leading the way, they could be primed for an upset in October.

A few Tampa Bay Rays players were enjoying a day off at the casino when they hit the jackpot. The slot machines were paying out Borderlands symbols, and each player walked away with a few thousand dollars.

"I've never seen anything like it," said shortstop Adeiny Hechavarria. "I was just playing for fun, and all of a sudden I won big. I couldn't believe it."

First baseman Logan Morrison had a similar experience. "I thought it was some kind of joke," he said. "But then I saw all the other players winning, too. It was definitely a lucky day for us."

With its unpredictable outcomes and generous payouts, it's no wonder that players are drawn to it like moths to a flame. So if you're looking for some excitement while you gamble, be sure to give Borderlands a try.

#  Tampa Bay Rays victorious thanks to Borderlands symbols appearing in slot machine game

The Tampa Bay Rays have announced that they are the winners of this year's MLB playoffs, and that the victory is due in part to symbols from the game Borderlands appearing on slot machines in the team's clubhouse.

"The Rays clubhouse has several slot machines, and late last night some of our players were playing those machines and noticed symbols from Borderlands appearing," said a club spokesperson. "We did some research and found out that those symbols are associated with good luck in the game. We all decided to play with those symbols in mind, and it clearly worked!"

Some experts are skeptical about the team's claims, saying that there is no concrete evidence that the symbols had anything to do with their win. But the Rays remain confident in their victory, and plan to celebrate by drinking lots of champagne and enjoying a parade through downtown Tampa.

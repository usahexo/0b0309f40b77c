#  How To Win At Osrs Blackjack Platon Online

Greetings adventurers,

In this guide, we will be discussing the best way to win at Blackjack in the Platon Online casino.

First, we would like to remind you that Blackjack is a game of chance and there are no guaranteed ways to win every time. However, with a bit of strategic planning and some basic knowledge, you can give yourself a better chance of coming out on top.

The aim of the game is simple - to achieve a total score of 21 points or less than the dealer's total score without going bust. In order to achieve this, you must firstly select which cards to keep and which to discard. The aim is then to draw another card that will not make your hand go over 21. If your hand exceeds 21 after drawing (known as 'busting'), you automatically lose the round even if the dealer also busts.

Here are some tips on how to improve your chances at winning:

1) Always remember that the Ace is worth 1 point or 11 points depending on what suits your strategy. Therefore, if you have an Ace and a 3 for example, your total score would be 14 (not 4). This is especially important when deciding whether to hit or stand with a hand of 12 for example. You may wish to hit in order to try and get a total score of 13 (Ace and 2), rather than standing and risking going over 21.

2) Another important thing to remember is that if you have two cards of the same rank (such as two Kings), you can split them into two separate hands. This increases your chances of winning as each hand will now have its own bet - but it also means that you are risking twice as much money! Make sure you are aware of when it is worth splitting your cards and when it is not. For example, splitting two eights is usually not advisable as the odds of getting a good card are low. However, splitting two Aces is always a good move as it gives you more chances to get close to 21 points without going bust.

3) As well as splitting cards, doubling down can also be a good way to increase your chances of winning. If you double down, you are essentially betting that your next card will be good enough to beat the dealer's hand - and if it is not, then you lose double what you initially bet. However, if it does win then you take home double your original winnings! Only do this if you feel confident about the next card being favourable though - don't just do it for the sake of it!

4) Finally, always remember that it is better to stop when you have 20 points or more than trying to hit another card in order to get 21 points exactly. This is because if you go over 21 points with your next card then you automatically lose - even if the dealer goes bust too! By stopping at 20 points or more, you guarantee yourself at least a push (a tie with the dealer where both players get their money back).

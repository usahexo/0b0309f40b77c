The United States Playing Card Company has been in business for over 130 years, and during that time they have produced some of the world’s most popular playing cards. In fact, their quality and craftsmanship is so renowned that they recently received a contract from a gaming commission to produce cards specifically for gambling purposes.

#  Gaming Commission denies application for “Pai Gow” poker game

The New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) unanimously voted to deny the application of casino operator Genting Group’s proposal to introduce the Chinese game “Pai Gow” poker at its Resorts World Catskills casino. Genting had applied in November 2018 to launch the new game, which is a variant of traditional poker that uses a 53-card deck including two jokers.

Commissioners expressed concerns over the impact the new game would have on the casino’s existing poker offerings, as well as on the state’s overall gaming industry. They cited a need to protect New York’s market share and ensure that any new games introduced at casinos are fair and safe for players.

Genting had hoped to attract Chinese players to its casino resort, which is positioned to compete with Atlantic City and other casinos in upstate New York. The company has said it will review the commission’s decision and decide whether or not to appeal.

The State Lottery Commission will introduce a Keno game with drawings twice a day, beginning on July 1.

In Keno, players choose numbers and bets may be placed on one or more of these numbers. Twenty randomly selected numbers will be drawn at each drawing. Players who match at least four out of the twenty numbers drawn win prizes. The size of the prize depends on how much the player wagered on their chosen numbers.

The Lottery Commission has been looking into adding a Keno game for some time and feels that this timing is right, with the fall football season around the corner. "Keno is a popular game and we think it will be well-received in North Carolina," said Executive Director Alice Garland.

The Racing and Gaming Commission has given the green light to rules governing blackjack tournaments, which will take effect on January 1. Under the new regulations, licensed casinos may offer blackjack tournaments provided that they meet certain requirements, including a buy-in of at least $25 per player.

Blackjack tournaments have become increasingly popular in recent years, as players look for new ways to enjoy the game. Tournaments can be a great way for novice players to learn the game, as well as a fun way for experienced players to test their skills.

The new rules help ensure that all participants in a blackjack tournament are playing on a level playing field. In order to comply with the regulations, casinos must strictly enforce tournament rules regarding betting limits and deck composition. Players are also limited to one entry per day in any given blackjack tournament.

Tournament directors must adhere to certain requirements as well, including maintaining a complete record of each hand played and making those records available to regulators upon request. They must also randomly select cards from the used decks in order to verify that they have not been manipulated in any way.

Blackjack tournaments offer a fun and exciting alternative to traditional casino gaming, and with these new regulations in place, players can rest assured that they are being played fairly and honestly.

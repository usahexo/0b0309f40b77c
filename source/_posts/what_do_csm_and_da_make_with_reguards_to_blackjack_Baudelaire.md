# What Do CSM and DA Make with Regards to Blackjack?

In the world of blackjack, there are various terms and abbreviations that you will come across, and two of these are CSM and DA. These two terms are related to the shuffling process and can have a significant impact on the game's outcome. In this article, we will explain what CSM and DA mean and how they affect the game of blackjack.

## What is CSM?

CSM stands for Continuous Shuffling Machine, which is an electronic device used by casinos to shuffle the cards in a game of blackjack. CSMs were introduced in the 2000s and have become very popular in the gambling industry due to their efficiency and effectiveness in shuffling the cards.

A CSM shuffles the cards after every hand, which means that the used cards are immediately returned to the machine, and the dealer draws new cards from the top of the shuffled deck. This means that there are no pauses in the game for shuffling, and the action is faster than it would be with a manual shuffle. The main advantage of CSMs is that they reduce the risk of card counting, which is a technique used by some players to gain an advantage over the house.

## What is DA?

DA stands for Dealer's Angel, which is a device used by dealers to help them shuffle the cards in a game of blackjack. A DA is a small plastic card with a vertical slit in the middle. The dealer inserts the cards into the slit and shuffles them, then removes them and places them back into the shoe. The DA is used to prevent the dealer from exposing the bottom card of the deck during the shuffle, which could be advantageous to a player who is counting cards.

## CSM vs. DA

The main difference between CSM and DA is that CSM shuffles the cards after every hand, while DA shuffles the cards after a certain number of hands have been played. This means that with a CSM, the cards are always being shuffled, and there is no predictability to the order in which the cards will come out. With a DA, the cards are shuffled at set intervals, which means that a player can try to track the cards and predict which cards will be dealt next.

CSMs are becoming more common in casinos, as they are faster and more efficient than manual shuffles. However, some players prefer DA because they believe it gives them a better chance of predicting which cards will be dealt next. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, CSM and DA are two different methods of shuffling the cards in a game of blackjack. CSM shuffles the cards after every hand, while DA shuffles the cards after a set number of hands. CSM reduces the risk of card counting, while DA allows for more predictability in the card order. Casinos use both methods, and it's up to the player to decide which one they prefer. However, it's important to note that regardless of the shuffling method, blackjack is still a game of chance, and the outcome of each hand is ultimately determined by luck.

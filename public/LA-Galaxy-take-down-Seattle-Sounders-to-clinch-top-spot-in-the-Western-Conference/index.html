<p>With the top spot in the Western Conference up for grabs, the Galaxy were clinical in their dismantling of the Sounders, winning 4-0 and securing first place with two games to spare.</p>
<p>It was an impressive performance from LA, who have now won eight of their last nine games. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was once again at the forefront of things for the Galaxy, scoring twice and proving a constant thorn in Seattle’s side.</p>
<p>But Saturday’s win was not all about Ibrahimovic; Giovani Dos Santos, Jonathan dos Santos and Romain Alessandrini also got on the scoresheet as Sigi Schmid’s men capitulated.</p>
<p>The result means that LA will now face Portland Timbers in the Western Conference semi-finals; a tie that they will be confident of winning after their excellent form in recent weeks.</p>
<h1 id="Columbus-Crew-pull-off-upset-of-Toronto-FC-to-claim-first-ever-MLS-Cup"><a href="#Columbus-Crew-pull-off-upset-of-Toronto-FC-to-claim-first-ever-MLS-Cup" class="headerlink" title="Columbus Crew pull off upset of Toronto FC to claim first ever MLS Cup"></a>Columbus Crew pull off upset of Toronto FC to claim first ever MLS Cup</h1><p>Toronto FC entered MLS Cup as the heavy favorites, but Columbus Crew had other ideas.</p>
<p>Led by the electric performance of winger Justin Meram, Columbus shocked Toronto with a 2-0 victory to claim their first ever MLS Cup.</p>
<p>It was a back and forth match, with both teams creating chances, but it was Columbus who took the lead in the first half through Meram’s well-taken strike.</p>
<p>The second half saw Toronto press for an equalizer, but they were unable to break down the stubborn Columbus defense.</p>
<p>And in injury time, Crew sealed the win through Ola Kamara’s neat finish.</p>
<h1 id="Atlanta-United-become-first-expansion-team-to-make-MLS-playoffs"><a href="#Atlanta-United-become-first-expansion-team-to-make-MLS-playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Atlanta United become first expansion team to make MLS playoffs"></a>Atlanta United become first expansion team to make MLS playoffs</h1><p>Atlanta United’s emphatic 5-0 victory over the Chicago Fire on Sunday confirmed their place in the MLS playoffs as well as being the first expansion team to ever make the postseason.</p>
<p>Led by young Venezuelan striker, Josef Martinez, Atlanta have been one of the surprise packages of this season’s MLS. Martinez has bagged an impressive 19 goals in just 23 appearances, putting him top of the league scoring charts.</p>
<p>Sunday’s win also saw Atlanta captain, Michael Parkhurst, reach a significant milestone, becoming the first player in Atlanta United’s history to play 100 games.</p>
<p>The playoffs will see Atlanta pitted against either New York City FC or Columbus Crew SC in what is sure to be an exciting encounter. NYCFC currently hold the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference but Columbus Crew are only 3 points behind with 2 games in hand.</p>
<h1 id="David-Villa-leads-New-York-City-FC-to-Eastern-Conference-Championship"><a href="#David-Villa-leads-New-York-City-FC-to-Eastern-Conference-Championship" class="headerlink" title="David Villa leads New York City FC to Eastern Conference Championship"></a>David Villa leads New York City FC to Eastern Conference Championship</h1><p>On November 6, 2017, David Villa led New York City FC to a 2-0 victory over Columbus Crew SC in the Eastern Conference Championship. This win propelled NYCFC to their first-ever appearance in the MLS Cup final, where they will face off against Atlanta United on December 9.</p>
<p>Villa was instrumental in NYCFC’s victory over Columbus Crew SC, scoring both of the team’s goals. His first goal came in the 33rd minute, when he beautifully volleyed a ball from Jack Harrison into the back of the net. Villa’s second goal came in the 73rd minute, after he was put through on goal by Alexander Ring and calmly finished past Zack Steffen.</p>
<p>In addition to his two goals, Villa also played an important role in setting up chances for his teammates. He linked up well with Maxi Moralez and David Accam throughout the game, creating several dangerous attacking opportunities for NYCFC.</p>
<p>Despite playing on an injured ankle, Villa proved to be a thorn in Columbus Crew SC’s side all night long. In particular, his dribbling ability and pinpoint passing wreaked havoc on the Columbus defense. He was constantly able to beat his man one-on-one and create chances for his teammates.</p>
<p>With David Villa leading the way, New York City FC have emerged as one of the strongest teams in MLS. They will now have a chance to win their first MLS Cup title when they take on Atlanta United on December 9.</p>
<h1 id="Sporting-Kansas-City-emerge-victorious-in-penalty-shootout-to-win-2017-U-S-Open-Cup"><a href="#Sporting-Kansas-City-emerge-victorious-in-penalty-shootout-to-win-2017-U-S-Open-Cup" class="headerlink" title="Sporting Kansas City emerge victorious in penalty shootout to win 2017 U.S. Open Cup"></a>Sporting Kansas City emerge victorious in penalty shootout to win 2017 U.S. Open Cup</h1><p> Sporting Kansas City defeated the New York Red Bulls in a penalty shootout to win the 2017 U.S. Open Cup on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>It was a tight contest throughout, with both sides having chances to take the lead. The first half ended goalless, and after neither side could find a breakthrough in extra time, the match went to penalties.</p>
<p>Sporting KC were perfect from the spot, while Luis Robles saved two of New York’s penalties as the visitors lifted their fourth U.S. Open Cup title.</p>
<p>“I want to say congratulations to our team,” Sporting KC manager Peter Vermes said after the game. “To win a championship, you have to do a lot of things well and I thought our guys did that tonight.”</p>
<p>“Obviously it’s disappointing,” added New York manager Jesse Marsch. “We had some good moments but we couldn’t finish them off.”</p>

<p>The legislation allows casinos and race tracks to offer bets on sporting events, with the Nevada Gaming Control Board regulating and taxing the activity. In addition to generating much-needed revenue for the state, lawmakers hope that legalized sports betting will help bolster tourism in Las Vegas and other parts of Nevada. </p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased crime and gambling addiction rates, but supporters say that those risks are worth taking in order to boost the economy. Governor Brian Sandoval is expected to sign the bill into law soon.</p>

<p>According to the ref, who spoke on condition of anonymity, he was given tens of thousands of dollars in cash to make calls that would benefit certain teams. In some cases, he was even asked to extend or shorten quarters or periods to help create advantageous betting opportunities for gamblers.</p>
<p>The ref claims that he and several colleagues routinely manipulated games for the benefit of organized crime syndicates, and that this has been going on for years.</p>
<p>“We were like puppets,” he said. “They pulled the strings and we danced.”</p>
<p>The NBA has responded by releasing a statement saying that it takes these allegations very seriously and is currently investigating the matter. It also vowed to “retract any championship banners or other honors bestowed on teams found to have participated in these activities.”</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that the NBA has had to deal with referee corruption. In 2007, referee Tim Donaghy was caught betting on games he officiated and later pled guilty to conspiracy charges.</p>
<h1 id="Why-legalized-sports-betting-may-be-the-next-big-thing-in-America"><a href="#Why-legalized-sports-betting-may-be-the-next-big-thing-in-America" class="headerlink" title="Why legalized sports betting may be the next big thing in America"></a>Why legalized sports betting may be the next big thing in America</h1><p>After the US Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May, 2018, opening up the door for legalized sports betting across most of the country, there has been a lot of discussion about what this means for American society. Some people see it as a positive development that will bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped state governments, while others are concerned that it will lead to increased rates of gambling addiction and other social ills.</p>
<p>However, one aspect that has received relatively little attention is how legalized sports betting could impact the world of professional sports. There is no doubt that gambling on sports is a huge industry, and one that is growing rapidly; in 2017, global wagers totaled more than $1 trillion. With so much money at stake, it’s not hard to imagine that legalized sports betting could have a significant impact on the way that professional sports are played and watched in America.</p>
<p>One possibility is that legalized sports betting could lead to an increase in match-fixing. As anyone who has ever watched a televised soccer match knows, corruption is already rampant in many international leagues, and there is no reason to believe that legalized sports betting would not provide even more opportunities for shady deals between players, coaches, and gamblers. It’s also possible that teams or individual players might become overly dependent on gambling revenues, leading them to make poor decisions on the field in order to win more bets.</p>
<p>Another concern is that legalizing sports betting could have a negative impact on attendance at sporting events. In countries where gambling on sports is legal, fans often show up to games simply to place bets, rather than because they are interested in the outcome of the match itself. This can lead to empty stadiums and less interest in watching sporting events on TV.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s also possible that legalized sports betting could have a positive effect on professional sports. For example, it could lead to increased viewership and larger television contracts as networks compete for the rights to broadcast sporting events. It could also lead to an increase in sponsorship deals as businesses try to tap into the lucrative gambling market.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it remains to be seen what impact legalized sports betting will have on professional sports in America. However, there is no doubt that this is an issue worth paying attention to, as it has the potential to significantly affect both the way we watch and participate in sport.</p>

The proposed bill, known as the “Sports Gaming Opportunity Act”, would allow each state to decide whether to legalize sports betting within its borders.</p>
<p>Proponents of the bill argue that overturning the ban would provide much-needed revenue to states, as well as create jobs in the gaming industry. They also claim that it would help to combat illegal sports betting, which is currently estimated to be a $150 billion industry.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it would lead to increased rates of gambling addiction, and could also has the potential to damage the integrity of professional sports.</p>
<p>The issue of legalizing sports betting has been gaining traction in recent years, with several states already moving to legalize it within their borders. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal ban on sports betting was unconstitutional, opening the door for states to move forward with legalization efforts.</p>
<h1 id="American-Gaming-Association-releases-study-finding-that-legal-sports-betting-would-create-160-000-jobs"><a href="#American-Gaming-Association-releases-study-finding-that-legal-sports-betting-would-create-160-000-jobs" class="headerlink" title="American Gaming Association releases study finding that legal sports betting would create 160,000 jobs"></a>American Gaming Association releases study finding that legal sports betting would create 160,000 jobs</h1><p>On July 31, the American Gaming Association (AGA) released a study that found that legal sports betting would create 160,000 jobs in the United States. This is welcome news as more and more states have begun to legalize sports betting in light of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal ban on sports betting in May. The report also found that legal sports betting would generate an additional $345 million in taxes each year.</p>
<p>The AGA has been a vocal proponent of legalizing sports betting and has worked with legislators in states around the country to advocate for its legalization. In fact, the AGA was one of the organizations that filed a lawsuit challenging the federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>“This report underscores what we have known all along: legalization of sports betting will create jobs and generate government revenue,” said Bill Miller, president and CEO of the AGA.</p>
<p>The release of this study comes at a time when several states are considering bills to legalize sports betting. Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have all passed laws to legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court’s ruling in May. New York and Rhode Island are also considering bills to legalize sports betting.</p>
